            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Apple Stole My Music. No, Seriously.</h1><p>"The software is functioning as intended," said Amber. "Wait," I asked, "so it's supposed to delete my personal files from my internal hard drive without asking my permission?" "Yes," she replied. I had just explained to Amber that 122 GB of music files were missing from my laptop.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e219e8b00b0b4e5cc1cd387b771cdfbea71cfffc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple now deletes files from its users’ computers. When I signed up for Apple Music, iTunes evaluated my massive collection of Mp3s and WAV files, scanned Apple’s database for what it considered matches, then removed the original files from my internal hard drive. REMOVED them. Deleted. If Apple Music saw a file it didn’t recognize—which came up often, since I’m a freelance composer and have many music files that I created myself—it would then download it to Apple’s database, delete it from my hard drive, and serve it back to me when I wanted to listen, just like it would with my other music files it had deleted.</p>]]></description>
